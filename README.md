consumption-tracker
===================

app easily tracks consumption of water (and eventually other life-tracking data) with a click of a button


Runs only on localhost currently -- and db info needs to be separated out into a separate file

Right now, I'm just using this at work every time I refill my water bottle - so it is extremely basic. Hoping to expand functionality soon.
